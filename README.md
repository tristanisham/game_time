Hey there everyone! My name's Tristan. I'm a streamer and fan of Minecraft: JE RS speedruns. Unfortunatly, for me I run a sole Linux (Pop_OS! k:5~>) installation, and tools like LiveSplit won't work, even with emulation software like Wine. Becuase of this, I decided to make a little program to replicate and eventually surpass LiveSplit for all operating systems.

GameTime is built in Rust on the [gtk-rs framework](https://gtk-rs.org/). I chose it for it's cross-platform porting and since this is such a small project there's no need for overkill (or underkill for that matter).
